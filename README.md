The Covid-19 pandemic is having a profound effect on our lives and psyche and we tend to avoid any
physical contact. For new students coming to university, going around campus can get very difficult
as they donâ€™t know the different school buildings, lecture halls, specific offices within buildings. With
the help of advancement in the field of robotics, we can switch the robot from playing a passive role
to an active role in our day-to-day lives for the betterment of us. Taking advantage of increasing
knowledge on robotics and using it to avoid close proximity between strangers, we plan to develop an
autonomous robot that can help guide an individual through unfamiliar places.
The project aims to develop an autonomous robot that helps an individual to find a destination by
walking them through the path. The robot will get the destination from the user through speech
recognition and communicate with the user to guide them to the destination. The robot will find the
shortest path to the destination and guide the user to the destination. Once it reaches the destination
the robot announces that the destination has arrived and after waiting there for a brief period it returns
to the base/original position.
One of the reasons we choose to do this project is because we get hands-on experience with
state-of-the-art robotics and developing complex systems which work together. Also, along with that,
this also helps contribute for betterment to society
