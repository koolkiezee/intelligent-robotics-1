The project aims to develop an autonomous robot that helps an individual to find a destination by
walking them through the path. The robot will get the destination from the user through speech
recognition and communicate with the user to guide them to the destination. The robot will find the
shortest path to the destination and guide the user to the destination. Once it reaches the destination
the robot announces that the destination has arrived and after waiting there for a brief period it returns
to the base/original position.
One of the reasons we choose to do this project is because we get hands-on experience with
state-of-the-art robotics and developing complex systems which work together. Also, along with that,
this also helps contribute for betterment to society
